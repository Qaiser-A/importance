Advertising

Third party products and services may be advertised to help us keep our game free to play using Unity ads for example among other advertising partners, for which you can find their privacy policy here: https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy . 
By advertising we can improve how we show you ads, such as showing you more relevant ads that may appeal to you more based on the information we collect. 
Information we collect for advertising purposes include Advertising IDs. Your data (including Advertising IDs) may be used to provide services by ad networks. Your Advertising ID may be shared with advertising partners for other advertising related purposes, and also to show you third party products and services through ads. 
Non personal information, such as your age or gender, may be collected and shared with our advertising partners who may combine this with information they have already collected from you when you use their service, to help deliver more relevant ads . 
To prevent seeing interest based advertising, you can go into your device’s settings and reset your Advertising ID or opt out of your Advertising ID being used to show you more relevant ads. Please note that this will not change your access to our game or how you play it, and only affects the relevancy of the ads shown to you when you play our game. 
We do not sell your personal information to third parties, but we may share your information with third parties for advertising purposes.
